-The value return:
+ Page 6 : n1.i = 5
+ Page 7 : n1.i = n2.i = 20
+ Page 9 : n = 15


-Diffirent between each code is the assigment value from class.
+ in page 6 we can see it assign from n1.i to n2.i so it convert value integer from n2 to n1.
+ in page 7 it assign the adress of n1 to n2 , so it will henritage all element store in it.
+ in page 9 in func f() it used reference to change the value of variable n.
